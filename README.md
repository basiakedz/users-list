# List of users ![Girl emoji](/public/favicon-32x32.png)

This mini App shows the list of users and allows to search certain person by name or location.

The application was started by another person and displayed a list of users. The application was devoid of user filtering functionality using the search bar - which was my main task. Thanks to this, I had the opportunity to learn how to analyze the application / existing code so as to understand what is connected with what, and to add new filtering functionality to someone's code and implement the entire application so that it is ready for the user.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

To start server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
